- Continue with the restructure until examples run
- Pull models out of tasks, move to other loc, and add any needed abstraction to add models for benchmark
- Move hparams from optimization experiments, others ('best' haparams for each combination?) to Bazel or otherwise make easily usable
- See if tasks beyond the five included in the optimization dir will work with all of the other stuff
- Check compatability of everything
- How to add some way of tracking resource use?
