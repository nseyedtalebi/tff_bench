def example_broadcast_encoder_fn(value):
  """Function for building encoded broadcast.

  This method decides, based on the tensor size, whether to use lossy
  compression or keep it as is (use identity encoder). The motivation for this
  pattern is due to the fact that compression of small model weights can provide
  only negligible benefit, while at the same time, lossy compression of small
  weights usually results in larger impact on model's accuracy.

  Args:
    value: A tensor or variable to be encoded in server to client communication.

  Returns:
    A `te.core.SimpleEncoder`.
