# tff_bench
A benchmarking utility that uses Tensorflow Federated to run simulations. Includes the experiments from the Google Research repo. I plan to take code from the examples and libraries in https://github.com/google-research/federated and combine them together with some glue code to get a basic framework for repeating the experiements included with Tensorflow Federated. The goal is to create something that would allow one to combine experiments and datasets in TFF and the Google Reasearch Federated repo to help explore the impact of changing out various parts of a canonical federated learning system more holistically. 
  
The idea came from P. Kairouz et al., “Advances and Open Problems in Federated Learning,” arXiv:1912.04977 [cs, stat], Dec. 2019, Accessed: Sep. 01, 2020. [Online]. Available: http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.04977.
