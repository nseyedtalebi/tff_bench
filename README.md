# tff_bench
A benchmarking utility that uses Tensorflow Federated to run simulations. Includes the experiments from the Google Research repo. I combined a few examples and libraries in https://github.com/google-research/federatedto to extend the federeated optimization benchmarks. The next step is to build on that and further extend it by incorporating more eamples and experiments from the Google repository. As I add more examples, I expect to see patterns that can be used to develop further abstractions and extensions.
  
The idea came from P. Kairouz et al., “Advances and Open Problems in Federated Learning,” arXiv:1912.04977 [cs, stat], Dec. 2019, Accessed: Sep. 01, 2020. [Online]. Available: http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.04977.
